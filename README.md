# Payment-Application
Payment systems are now available everywhere and everyone interacts with these systems every day.

There are different types of transactions you can make, SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID.

- SALE: means to buy something and its price will be deducted from your bank account.
- REFUND: this means that you will return something and wants your money back to your bank account.
- Pre-Authorization: means holding an amount of money from your account, e.g Hotel reservation.
- VOID: this means canceling the transaction, e.g if the seller entered the wrong amount.
